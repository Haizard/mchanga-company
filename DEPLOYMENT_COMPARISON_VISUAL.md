           ├─ WebSocket
           └─ MongoDB connection
           │
           ▼
           MongoDB Atlas
```

### Cost
```
Frontend: $7/month (Starter)
Backend:  $7/month (Starter)
Total:    $14/month
```

### Setup
```
1. Create backend service
2. Create frontend service
3. Configure CORS
4. Configure URLs
5. Deploy both
Total: 10 minutes
```

### Performance
```
Frontend Load: 1-2 seconds
API Response: 150-250ms (cross-origin)
Total: 2-3 seconds
```

## Side-by-Side Comparison

### URLs
```
COMBINED:
  https://lite-kideko-aggregates.onrender.com

SEPARATE:
  Frontend: https://lite-kideko-aggregates-frontend.onrender.com
  Backend:  https://lite-kideko-aggregates-backend.onrender.com
```

### Cost
```
COMBINED:  $7/month  ✅ Cheaper
SEPARATE:  $14/month ❌ More expensive
Savings:   $84/year
```

### Performance
```
COMBINED:  1.5-2.5 seconds  ✅ Faster
SEPARATE:  2-3 seconds      ❌ Slower
Improvement: 20-30% faster
```

### CORS
```
COMBINED:  No CORS needed  ✅ Simpler
SEPARATE:  CORS required   ❌ More complex
```

### Scaling
```
COMBINED:  Scale together  ❌ Limited
SEPARATE:  Scale independently  ✅ Flexible
```

### Maintenance
```
COMBINED:  1 service  ✅ Simpler
SEPARATE:  2 services ❌ More complex
```

## Decision Tree

```
Do you need independent scaling?
│
├─ YES → Use SEPARATE deployment
│        (Scale frontend/backend independently)
│
└─ NO → Use COMBINED deployment ✅
        (Save money, simpler setup)
        │
        ├─ Do you want to save $84/year?
        │  └─ YES → COMBINED ✅
        │
        ├─ Do you want 20-30% faster performance?
        │  └─ YES → COMBINED ✅
        │
        ├─ Do you want simpler deployment?
        │  └─ YES → COMBINED ✅
        │
        └─ Do you want single URL?
           └─ YES → COMBINED ✅
```

## Migration Path

### If You Start with Combined
```
Combined (1 service)
    │ (if traffic increases)
    ▼
Separate (2 services)
    │ (easy migration)
    ▼
Microservices (many services)
```

### If You Start with Separate
```
Separate (2 services)
    │ (if you want to simplify)
    ▼
Combined (1 service)
    │ (harder migration)
    ▼
Microservices (many services)
```

**Easier to start with COMBINED and scale up later!**
